Don’t abandon the “Hands off the ‘Net” approach begun under President Clinton, which unleashed staggering innovation. That bipartisan approach made possible the $1.3 trillion dollars of private investment that built today’s broadband networks. Imposing Title II would hurt all Americans by slowing broadband deployment and creating a cloud of uncertainty over all Internet services. 

Title II’s draconian rules were designed in the 1930s for AT&T’s government-created monopoly. They’re a poor fit for the Internet. FCC Chairmen Bill Kennard (D, 1997-2001) and Michael Powell (R, 2001-2005) knew that. So they wisely drew a clear, bright line between Title II and the Internet. We don’t buy claims that the FCC can maintain this firewall if it re-opens Title II. Nor do we trust that the FCC can quickly whittle Title II into something resembling today’s bipartisan “Hands off the Net” approach. You can’t have “just enough Title II” any more than you can be “slightly pregnant.”

Title II would hurt startups most: they can’t cope with regulation as easily as big companies. Title II would protect incumbent broadband companies from new entrants like Google Fiber. Title II would hurt the underserved by slowing deployment and upgrades in minority and rural communities. And Title II would vastly increase the FCC’s powers over the Internet. Remember, you won’t be Chairman forever, and the powers you claim over the Internet today could be used to control it in ways you don’t intend. 

Yet, as you’ve noted, Title II wouldn’t even allow the FCC to do what its proponents demand: ban “fast lanes.” 

We urge you to carefully focus regulation on real problems, what Chairman Kennard called “vigilant restraint.” But remember Kennard’s digital mantra, too: “First, do no harm.” If you conclude that existing laws aren’t adequate to protect consumers, you should ask Congress for legislation that clearly specifies the boundaries of the FCC’s authority. No government agency should be trusted with a blank check to regulate the Internet at whim — whether that’s Title II or the vast powers the FCC has claimed under Section 706 to do anything it thinks will promote broadband.

Most of all, we want continually better, faster broadband and more competition. Instead of imposing Title II, we urge you to identify regulatory barriers at all levels of government that could be removed to help existing companies keep upgrading their networks, but also help Google Fiber, wireless providers and other private companies to compete. 

Competition, not endless litigation and political bickering over Title II, should be your legacy.

		What the Heck is <strong>Title II</strong>?
		</h1>
		<p>
		There’s a debate raging about how the FCC should regulate the Internet. Some advocates are pushing for “Title II.” That’s code for 1930s-style utility regulation. Title II would put the FCC squarely in the middle of the Internet — right beside the NSA. It saddles the Internet with price controls and other heavy-handed rules from a thankfully long-gone era. The debate over Title II isn’t a debate over net neutrality, which is why many net neutrality proponents actually oppose Title II. Instead, it’s a debate between a vocal group of self-appointed “consumer advocates” who want greater government control over broadband companies, and defenders of a bipartisan consensus around a “Hands Off the Internet” approach.

It would hurt <a href="#startup">startups</a> by saddling them with excessive regulation, and it would protect big broadband companies from new competitors, leaving consumers with even fewer choices.

In essence, they want to maintain the “Hands Off The Net” approach begun under the Clinton Administration.

They’ve urged the FCC not to abandon the FCC’s long-standing approach of “vigilant restraint” taken by Democrat Bill Kennard and Republican Michael Powell. The FCC’s first two African-American Chairmen knew that underserved groups would benefit most from investment in broadband. They were right – and their restrained approach has made broadband companies far and away the largest source of private investment in the U.S. Title II would choke the investment needed to finish bridging the Digital Divide.

				<p>
				 Even though no broadband provider is actually blocking web content (contrary to popular assumption), a clear ban on blocking might make sense, just to be safe. But that can be done without Title II. What upstart companies do need are clear, bright-line rules that keep the government’s hands off their content businesses. Invoking Title II opens the door to FCC regulation of all web businesses, creating a cloud of uncertainty that will choke investment in startups. Startups also need better broadband service for all users, a goal Title II would undermine.

				Title II will encourage <strong>broadband competition.</strong>
				</h3>
				<h2>
				Truth:
				</h2>
				<h3>
				Title II would actually <strong><em>protect</em> cable and telcos from competition.</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
				The bipartisan decision to protect broadband from the extreme regulatory intervention of Title II was essential to encouraging telcos to compete with cable companies. That’s why <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-327829A1.pdf#page=11" >92% of U.S. homes</a> have two strong broadband pipes and U.S. fiber deployment is <a href="https://www.law.upenn.edu/live/files/3352-us-vs-european-broadband-deployment#page=13">twice</a> that of Europe. Google Fiber and other small companies are trying to build yet a third pipe, but the regulatory costs and legal uncertainty of Title II would probably kill their plans. The fastest way to destroy a vibrant and expanding market is to inject an overbearing regulator, the chaos of legal uncertainty, and the kind of regulatory capture we’ve come to expect from the FCC. That doesn’t require corruption — it’s just how government  works when laws are vague and bureaucrats have too much discretion.

				<strong>Title II doesn’t ban fast lanes</strong>, and actually might make paid prioritization more likely.
				</h3>
				<p>
				 As draconian as Title II is in other respects, it still wouldn’t allow the FCC to ban paid prioritization. In fact, the FCC’s authority to do so under Title II is pretty much the same as the authority it claims under Section 706 — which is why all this “We Need Title II Now!” stuff is so disingenuous. But what Title II will do is saddle the Internet with <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/205">retail price controls</a> and other new burdens. These might well force broadband providers to turn to paid prioritization as a new revenue source.

				<h3>
				<strong>Netflix is just playing politics to gain a business edge.</strong> 
				</h3>
				<p>
				Netflix talks about “strong net neutrality,” but is really just trying to cut its costs. Understandably, Netflix wants more broadband capacity and faster connections to its customers. But instead of simply offering to pay for these benefits (as it’s always had to do), Netflix is promoting a Rube Goldberg regulatory regime to offload those costs onto broadband providers. That means all broadband subscribers would have to pay, whether they use Netflix or not. Netflix is trying to game the system to lower its costs — just as it tried to do with the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20071205/162419.shtml">Post Office</a> back when it shipped DVDs. That’s great for Netflix, but not for the rest of us.

				<h3>
				<strong>The FCC won’t be able to "go easy" on Title II and has a long track record of overreaching.</strong> 
				</h3>
				<p>
				There’s just no middle ground on Title II: Once the FCC invokes it, it will have a hard time undoing the law’s chilling effects on investment and innovation across the Internet. Those pushing Title II should know better than to trust the FCC. The Commission has a long history of overreaching, from trying to to stamp out copyright infringement to “cleaning up” television and helping favored companies. Citing the FCC’s long history of being manipulated by the companies it regulates, some leading net neutrality advocates have even called for the FCC’s <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/lessig-its-time-demolish-fcc-83409%20%20%20">“demolition.”</a> Some also claim Title II would be less dangerous than Section 706 as the basis for new net neutrality rules. But invoking Title II won’t stop the FCC from using 706, too. So the FCC would just have two <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/01/one-talking-comes-net-neutrality/">blank checks</a> to regulate the Internet instead of one!

		While [Title II’s] structural restrictions like open access may serve other interests, as a remedy to promote the neutrality of the network they are potentially counterproductive. Proponents of open access have generally overlooked the fact that, <span style="font-size: 22px;font-weight:100;color: rgb(157, 209, 255);">to the extent an open access rule inhibits vertical relationships, it can help maintain the Internet’s greatest deviation from network neutrality.</span>

		Clearing Up the <strong>History</strong>
		</h1>
		<h3>
		<stong>The fight over Title II isn’t between Republicans and Democrats. It’s between a radical fringe and defenders of a bipartisan consensus.</strong>
		</h3>
		<p>
		 That consensus formed in the '90s. <strong>Sensible politicians agreed over maintaining a "light touch" regulatory approach to the Internet in order promote broadband investment</strong> and keep Internet services <strong>free of unnecessary regulation.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
		 In fact, <strong>Clinton and Gore tried to move beyond the rigid approach of Title II,</strong> but their Telecommunications Act of 1994 never took off. So, after Congress finally passed the backwards-looking 1996 Act, Bill Kennard, Clinton’s second FCC Chairman, started <strong>walling the Internet off from Title II.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
		Had Gore won the 2000 election, Kennard probably would have done largely what Chairman Michael Powell did under President Bush: finally declare that the <strong>“Era of Title II is over”</strong> — just as Clinton famously said “The Era of Big Government is Over.”

        <h2>
          Instead of Title II, We Want:
        </h2>
		<h3>
		A Clear Line between the Internet and Public Utilities
		</h3>
		<p>
		Re-interpreting the complex definitions of the Act and trying to apply 1930s regulations to today’s Internet will inevitably make clear lines impossible. Whatever the FCC does about net neutrality, it shouldn’t re-open Title II.  
		</p>
		<h3>
		Maintain “Vigilant Restraint” 
		</h3>
		<p>
		That was FCC Chairman Bill Kennard’s slogan. It remains the right approach to policing the Internet. Enforce existing laws. If and when those prove inadequate, look for <strong>narrowly tailored solutions</strong> – scalpels, not sledgehammers!
		</p>
		<h3>
		Congressional Compromise
		</h3>
		<p>
		The FCC’s legal authority over net neutrality is hotly contested, but Congress can fix that. Democrats and Republicans should join in a bipartisan compromise that sets out clear, but specific and narrow, authority over core net neutrality concerns. Congress should bar the FCC from ever applying Title II to the Internet. It should also clarify that “promoting broadband” can’t be a blank check for the FCC to regulate anything it wants to — lest the FCC use Section 706 to wield <a href="http://www.wired.com/opinion/2014/01/one-talking-comes-net-neutrality/">even greater power</a> than under Title II. 
		</p>
		<h3>
		Unleash Broadband Competition
		</h3>
		<p>
		The “light-touch” approach that has governed the Internet since the 1990s was essential to driving investment in broadband, and driving telephone companies to compete with cable companies. They continue forcing each other to upgrade their networks. 
		</p>
		<p>
		But we need a third pipe (like Google Fiber) and faster wireless, too. Let’s remove the local red tape that makes upgrades hard and new entry into the broadband market even harder. The Federal government should let go of some of the spectrum it isn’t using — to make wireless broadband faster.
		</p>
		<h3>
		Smart Infrastructure
		</h3>
        <p>
        Before rushing to build government-owned broadband networks (What Would Snowden Say?!?), cities should install conduits under streets that any broadband company can rent. That’s a smart Democrat idea, which the Obama administration has <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/14/executive-order-accelerating-broadband-infrastructure-deployment">embraced, but not followed through on.</a> That’s the cheapest, smartest way to promote real broadband competition — without putting taxpayers on the hook for running or upgrading evolving broadband networks.

            <textarea placeholder="Dear FCC: ...">Dear Chairman Wheeler, please don’t break the Internet. Don’t abandon the “Hands off the ‘Net” approach begun under President Clinton, which unleashed staggering innovation. That bipartisan approach made possible the $1.3 trillion dollars of private investment that built today’s broadband networks. Imposing Title II would hurt all Americans by slowing broadband deployment and creating a cloud of uncertainty over all Internet services. 

Title II’s draconian rules were designed in the 1930s for AT&T’s government-created monopoly. They’re a poor fit for the Internet. FCC Chairmen Bill Kennard (D, 1997-2001) and Michael Powell (R, 2001-2005) knew that. So they wisely drew a clear, bright line between Title II and the Internet. We don’t buy claims that the FCC can maintain this firewall if it re-opens Title II. Nor do we trust that the FCC can quickly whittle Title II into something resembling today’s bipartisan “Hands off the Net” approach. You can’t have “just enough Title II” any more than you can be “slightly pregnant.”

Title II would hurt startups most: they can’t cope with regulation as easily as big companies. Title II would protect incumbent broadband companies from new entrants like Google Fiber. Title II would hurt the underserved by slowing deployment and upgrades in minority and rural communities. And Title II would vastly increase the FCC’s powers over the Internet. Remember, you won’t be Chairman forever, and the powers you claim over the Internet today could be used to control it in ways you don’t intend. 

Yet, as you’ve noted, Title II wouldn’t even allow the FCC to do what its proponents demand: ban “fast lanes.” 

We urge you to carefully focus regulation on real problems, what Chairman Kennard called “vigilant restraint.” But remember Kennard’s digital mantra, too: “First, do no harm.” If you conclude that existing laws aren’t adequate to protect consumers, you should ask Congress for legislation that clearly specifies the boundaries of the FCC’s authority. No government agency should be trusted with a blank check to regulate the Internet at whim — whether that’s Title II or the vast powers the FCC has claimed under Section 706 to do anything it thinks will promote broadband.

Most of all, we want continually better, faster broadband and more competition. Instead of imposing Title II, we urge you to identify regulatory barriers at all levels of government that could be removed to help existing companies keep upgrading their networks, but also help Google Fiber, wireless providers and other private companies to compete. 

Competition, not endless litigation and political bickering over Title II, should be your legacy.
